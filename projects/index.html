            <h3>Drum Lights</h3>
            <p>
                Possibly my greatest project, my drum lights were a reactive lighting system for my marching tenors.
                I created the system using an Arduino Due, some Adafruit NeoPixels, and some drum triggers.
                It took me about 2 months to get the project to its current state, and I plan to continue the project in the future.
