            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p class="indent">
                My name is Alex Schoepf, and I am a senior in high school.
                I have a love for all things tech, and I am always eager to learn new things.
                I participate in my school's band program, robotics team, and stege crew.
                I am also in the Math and Science Center, an accelerated STEM program.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Chefycraft?</h3>
            <p class="indent">
                My last name is Schoepf (pronounced Chef), and my friends call me Chefy.
                Originally, "craft" came from Minecraft, but since then has more represented my work as a whole.
                Yeah it's weird, but I really don't care.
